# PR: Major Bug Fixes and New Features for Discovery Node

## Summary
This PR introduces critical bug fixes for search and ingestion issues, along with new filtering and comparison features that enhance the Discovery Node's capabilities.

## Changes Made

### üêõ Bug Fixes

1. **Fixed @cmp:media objects not being returned in search results** (#issue-ref)
   - Enhanced media extraction to properly handle @cmp:media fields
   - Updated formatters to include correct JSON-LD context

2. **Fixed duplicate offers bug during ingestion** (#issue-ref)
   - Changed from index-based to URN-based product matching
   - Added offer deduplication logic to prevent duplicates

3. **Fixed MCP server database session management** (#issue-ref)
   - Implemented factory pattern for proper session lifecycle
   - Prevents connection leaks and improves stability

### ‚ú® New Features

1. **Request ID Generation and Caching System**
   - 6-character request IDs for all API responses
   - 15-minute Redis caching on separate database (db 2)
   - Enables result persistence and operation chaining

2. **Product Filtering API**
   - POST `/api/v1/filter` endpoint
   - Natural language filtering (waterproof, eco-friendly, etc.)
   - Price range filtering
   - Returns filtered results with new request ID

3. **Product Comparison API**
   - POST `/api/v1/compare` endpoint
   - Compare 2-5 products by index
   - Auto-detects comparison aspects
   - Provides recommendations and narrative summary

## Testing
- ‚úÖ All existing tests pass
- ‚úÖ Added unit tests for new services
- ‚úÖ Added integration tests for new endpoints
- ‚úÖ Manually tested all bug fixes and features

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test filtering functionality
python test_filter_service_direct.py

# Test comparison functionality  
python test_comparison_direct.py

# Run integration tests (requires server running)
python test_filtering.py
python test_comparison.py
```

## API Examples

### Filter Products
```bash
# Filter cached search results
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/filter \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "request_id": "K3M9X2",
    "filter_criteria": "waterproof",
    "max_price": 100,
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

### Compare Products
```bash
# Compare products at indices 0, 1, and 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/compare \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "request_id": "K3M9X2",
    "indices": [0, 1, 2],
    "comparison_aspects": ["price", "features"]
  }'
```

## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible.

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. Uses existing Redis and database connections.

## Performance Impact
- ‚úÖ Improved search performance with caching
- ‚úÖ Reduced duplicate data during ingestion
- ‚úÖ Better resource utilization with proper session management

## Security Considerations
- Request IDs are randomly generated and time-limited (15 min)
- No sensitive data exposed in cache
- Proper input validation on all new endpoints

## Documentation
- All new endpoints documented in OpenAPI/Swagger
- MCP tools include comprehensive descriptions
- Test files serve as usage examples

## Checklist
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Self-review completed
- [x] Comments added for complex logic
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] No new warnings generated
- [x] Tests added and passing
- [x] Dependent changes merged

## Files Changed
- **Bug Fixes**: 6 files modified
- **New Features**: 8 files added, 4 files modified
- **Tests**: 4 new test files added

## Next Steps
After merging, consider:
1. Monitoring cache hit rates
2. Adding metrics for comparison usage
3. Extending filter patterns based on user feedback
